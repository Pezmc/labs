[Electromagnetic Field](https://www.emfcamp.org) is a non-profit camping festival for those with an inquisitive mind or an interest in making things: hackers, artists, geeks, crafters, scientists, and engineers.

A temporary town of nearly three thousand like-minded people enjoying a long weekend of talks, performances, and workshops on everything from blacksmithing to biometrics, chiptunes to computer security, high altitude ballooning to lockpicking, origami to democracy, and online privacy to knitting.

I've been involved since 2016 and currently serve as the Event Operations Lead, helping to organize the infrastructure, logistics, and operations that make the festival possible.
