Put together during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic to help people keep in touch with
family and friends while stuck at home.

Contains a collection of tools, games and activities people can engage in
remotely! Some personal favourites include

[Fake Artist](https://github.com/kcgidw/fao) and
[Codenames](https://www.horsepaste.com/).

Hosted publicly on Github so people can add their own suggestions!
