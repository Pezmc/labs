I spent the summer of 2012 volunteering for the Olympic Opening Ceremony in London as a performer in the [Industrial Revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QL_uG2GSZo) section. The ceremony, directed by Danny Boyle, featured over 10,000 volunteers who brought to life a spectacular celebration of British history and culture in front of a global audience of nearly a billion viewers.
