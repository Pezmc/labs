A full blog post on this project is long overdue, but in the mean time here is a
high level overview.

For Halloween 2019 I built a smart mirror powered by a Raspberry Pi and an old
Dell LCD. The setup consisted of a two way mirror on top the LCD with a wooden
"picture frame" built around it to conceal the power supply, speaker and
Raspberry Pi.

The Pi was connected to the screen and a PIR and triggered a random full screen
video using a
[Python script](https://github.com/Pezmc/SpookTastic/blob/master/main.py) as
well as flickering the lights!

I'll maybe add a video and some photos to this post of it in action and the
build process!
