A WhatsApp community that brings together various social groups in Leuven to aid discoverability and make it easier for people to find activities and events that interest them.

The community serves as a catch-all for social groups, with next to no impact on individual groups—the focus is making it easier to find stuff you might like. It contains many sub-groups for all sorts of topics including:

- Hiking - regular weekend (and sometimes weekday) hikes
- Café Co-Working - weekly co-work/study meet-ups
- Photography - group outings and lessons
- Ultimate Frisbee - regular beginner-friendly games
- Board Games - ad-hoc board game events
- Handball - weekly beginner-friendly trainings
- Live Music - checking out cool musicians and live venues in Belgium and beyond
- Badminton - for badminton lovers at all levels
- Climbing - for climbing enthusiasts
- Travel Buddies - organizing day trips and vacations
- Scavenger Hunt - team-based interactive search games across Leuven

Founded and helped sculpt out the group, resolve conflict, and help people host events. The community emphasizes respect, inclusivity, and a zero-tolerance policy for harassment or discrimination.
