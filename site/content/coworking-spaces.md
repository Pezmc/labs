A simple directory of laptop-friendly cafés and coworking spots in and around Leuven, Belgium.

The site makes it easy to filter spaces by various criteria to help remote workers, students, and digital nomads find the perfect spot to work from. Built with Vue and TypeScript. It replaces a google sheet I was maintaining.
