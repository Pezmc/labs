In early 2020 I tried to organise a ski trip for digital nomads, despite
hundreds of people signing up, and active Slack community and some paid
deposits, it fell through. I simply couldn't get enough deposits to secure a
chalet and then COVID took over!

I currently intend to try again in 2021! This is the website for that event!
