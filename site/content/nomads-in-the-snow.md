In early 2020 I tried to organise a ski trip for digital nomads, despite
hundreds of people signing up, and active Slack community and some paid
deposits, it fell through. I simply couldn't get enough deposits to secure a
chalet and then COVID took over!

As of 2025, this project is effectively defunct, but the website is still online.
